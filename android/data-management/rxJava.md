# what is rxJava?

it's an extension of the ReactiveX project made by netflix.
Basically, it helps with the reaction time of when data appears.
It's kind of a thread thing if you recall from learning java.

goals of the Reactive project

- responsive, must be quick
- message driven, asynchronous message-passing between components
- elastic, it's responsive even under high load
- resilient, even if a component fails it's still responsive.

## RxJava components

- Observables, kind of like a stream, it sends data,
- Observer, subscribes to Observable's data sequence, handling it one at a time, it is notified whenever Obsrvable emits the data.
