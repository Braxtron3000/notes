Android provides the [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) class.

it also provides a [binding library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) (i think to help the viewmodel to retrieve data but i haven't read that far yetðŸ¥´)

it helps...
* the UI data to survive configuration changes like screen rotations.
* simplify a complex program
