# advanced training techniques

 **olympic lifts**
* clean
* snatch
* jerk
these are total body exercises

## advanced training techniques
*train beyond fatigue*


### heavy negatives
* need spotter
* load bar/machine to 20-40% > 1rm and perform **only the ECC phase**

### functional isometrics
* reps performed a few inches for 2-6secs see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBWmEWq256E)
* goal is to increase **strength** at weakest point
* use for bench, deadlift, squat, & clean pull
* 19.4% strength increase compared to without: 11.9%

### partial repetitions

### variable resistance training
* applying bands to bar to make it harder at a certain place in ROM

### overloads
* lifting heavier to make next loads feel lighter (see heavy negatives)
* ex: attempting 400lbs so you can lift 375lbs
* trains neuromuscular system to take load

### forced repetitions
* reps completed with help from spotter
* **endurance, strength, and hypertrophy**
* use with caution (greater fatigue)
* increases testosterone (not free) for strength trained individuals
    * greater elevations in cortisol & growth hormone

### noncontinuous sets (for **strength** & **power**)
* pausing between reps

### quality training
* gradually decreasing rest time within program

### breakdown sets (descending sets, drop sets, multipoundage system) **best with spotter**
* quickly reduce load with minimal rest
* used by elite athletes but not much research
* used mostly for **hypertrophy**
    * but can also be used for **strength**: near maximal weight with an additional 1-2 reps and 5% weight drop

### spectrum repetition **hypertrophy**
* using low, moderate, & high reps per workout
* 6-20 system
    * begins with (3 sets of) reps of 6 & ends with (3 sets of) reps of 20
* 5-10-20
    * 3 exercises working same muscle groups
    1. 5 reps (multiple sets)
    2. 10 reps (multiple sets)
    3. 20 reps (multiple sets)

### super sets **hypertrophy & endurance**
* if for hypertrophy use for same muscle group
* if for strenght use unrelated muscle groups
