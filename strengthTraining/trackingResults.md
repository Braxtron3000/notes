# tracking results

## body measurements
* skin calipers p.455
    * this is easy to look up the equation for
    * girth measurements

## strength testing
p.457
**testing 1rm** 
1. light warm-up 5-10 reps 40-60% of guessed max
2. 1 min rest, then 3-5 reps of 60-80%
3. Conservative increase then a 1rm attempt
    * if not made 3 min rest and try again. up to 3-5 sets

## ways to measure power
vertical & long jump

## measuring agility

## estimated 1rm bench press equations
* brzycki
    * 1rm = wt/1.0278-.0278(#reps)
    * %rm = 102.78-2.78(#reps)
* Epley
* Lander
* Mayner

the closer 1rm it is the more accurate the estimation. No more than 10rm.

## estimated Running speed
p. 469
1. run 1.5 miles while recording on stop watch
2. punch result into the 1.5 mile equation

Other tests include:
* 12 min. run
* multistage 20m shuttle run
