# Periodization

## classical model (linear periodization)
p.437

phase | intenstity | time frame
----- | ----------- | -------- 
hypertrophy phase | 3-5s of 8-20rps for 50-75%| 4-12 weeks
strength phase | 3-5s of 4-6rps for 80-85%| 1-3 months
strength/power phase| 3-5s of 2-5rps for 85-90%| 8 weeks
peaking phase | 3-5s of 1-3rps for >90%| 3-4weeks
maintnance phase| 1-3s of 6-8rps for 80-85%| length of off-season

## undulating model (nonlinear periodization)
essentially in this model the phases are shortened from spanning months to either weeks or even within a week

**undulated daily example**

* Monday - light
* Wednesday - hypertrophy
* Friday - strength

**undulated weekly example**
* week1 - 70%
* week2 - 80%
* week3 - 90%

## Reverse periodization linear Periodization 
this is the exact opposite of classical model and its for endurance
