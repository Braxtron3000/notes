# advanced training techniques
*train beyond fatigue*

## olympic lifts
* clean
* snatch
* jerk
these are total body exercises

## heavy negatives
* need spotter
* load bar/machine to 20-40% > 1rm and perform **only the ECC phase**

## functional isometrics
* reps performed a few inches for 2-6secs see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBWmEWq256E)
* goal is to increase **strength** at weakest point
* use for bench, deadlift, squat, & clean pull
* 19.4% strength increase compared to without: 11.9%

## partial repetitions

## variable resistance training
* applying bands to bar to make it harder at a certain place in ROM

## overloads
* lifting heavier to make next loads feel lighter (see heavy negatives)
* ex: attempting 400lbs so you can lift 375lbs
* trains neuromuscular system to take load

## forced repetitions
* reps completed with help from spotter
* **endurance, strength, and hypertrophy**
* use with caution (greater fatigue)
* increases testosterone (not free) for strength trained individuals
    * greater elevations in cortisol & growth hormone

## noncontinuous sets (for **strength** & **power**)
* pausing between reps

## quality training
* gradually decreasing rest time within program

## breakdown sets (descending sets, drop sets, multipoundage system) **best with spotter**
* quickly reduce load with minimal rest
* used by elite athletes but not much research
* used mostly for **hypertrophy**
    * but can also be used for **strength**: near maximal weight with an additional 1-2 reps and 5% weight drop

## spectrum repetition **hypertrophy**
* using low, moderate, & high reps per workout
* 6-20 system
    * begins with (3 sets of) reps of 6 & ends with (3 sets of) reps of 20
* 5-10-20
    * 3 exercises working same muscle groups
    1. 5 reps (multiple sets)
    2. 10 reps (multiple sets)
    3. 20 reps (multiple sets)

## super sets **hypertrophy & endurance**
* if for hypertrophy use for same muscle group
* if for strenght use unrelated muscle groups

# periodization
*avoid peaking, plan ahead*

## classical model (linear periodization)
p.437

phase | intenstity | time frame
----- | ----------- | -------- 
hypertrophy phase | 3-5s of 8-20rps for 50-75%| 4-12 weeks
strength phase | 3-5s of 4-6rps for 80-85%| 1-3 months
strength/power phase| 3-5s of 2-5rps for 85-90%| 8 weeks
peaking phase | 3-5s of 1-3rps for >90%| 3-4weeks
maintnance phase| 1-3s of 6-8rps for 80-85%| length of off-season

## undulating model (nonlinear periodization)
essentially in this model the phases are shortened from spanning months to either weeks or even within a week

**undulated daily example**

* Monday - light
* Wednesday - hypertrophy
* Friday - strength

**undulated weekly example**
* week1 - 70%
* week2 - 80%
* week3 - 90%

## Reverse periodization linear Periodization 
this is the exact opposite of classical model and its for endurance

# tracking results
*Review progress. Learn from mistakes. Grow Quicker*

## body measurements
* skin calipers p.455
    * this is easy to look up the equation for
    * girth measurements

## strength testing
p.457
**testing 1rm** 
1. light warm-up 5-10 reps 40-60% of guessed max
2. 1 min rest, then 3-5 reps of 60-80%
3. Conservative increase then a 1rm attempt
    * if not made 3 min rest and try again. up to 3-5 sets

## ways to measure power
vertical & long jump

## measuring agility

## estimated 1rm bench press equations
* brzycki
    * 1rm = wt/1.0278-.0278(#reps)
    * %rm = 102.78-2.78(#reps)
* Epley
* Lander
* Mayner

the closer 1rm it is the more accurate the estimation. No more than 10rm.

## estimated Running speed
p. 469
1. run 1.5 miles while recording on stop watch
2. punch result into the 1.5 mile equation

Other tests include:
* 12 min. run
* multistage 20m shuttle run


# workout structure & technique

## structure
* multijoint & olympic lifts are first
* warmups are until you get loose
* **progression structure**: after performing the same lift "160 for 8 reps" for 2 weeks in a row up the ante. you won't lift for the same # of reps but  thats o.k.
* **three methods of progression** 
    * increase relative percents
    * train within RM zone
    * increase absolute amnts
* **3 types of plans** 
    1. full body
    2. split (upper & lower)
    3. specific (chest day, leg day, back day, etc.)
    



* **progression structure**: increase by 2-10% once you can do 1-2 reps over the rep zone for 2 consecutive workouts


## general technique
* do quick fast reps for strength (power)
* you need variation of intensity in your workout. So not always 80-90%.
* range builds strength
    * heavy weights 1-6rps or 80-100% 
    * stay away from near 1rm lifts as it hurts joints.

* muscle grows in all three rep ranges but the most in 6-12 range

rep range | goal
----------|-----
1-6 rps | strength
6-12 rps | hypertrophy
10-15 rps| endurance

* rest: 2-3 minutes for strength, 30-40s for low intensity

* **hypertrophy technique** - preexaustion: start with single joint before multiple joint to fatigue a certain muscle

* *volume* = # total # of sets & reps
* **volume load** = load lifted X # of sets X reps
* *Intensity* = % of 1rm being lifted

## recommended volume
workout | total volume | division | 
--------|--------|-------------
total body|3-6 sets | 3-6 sets or 1-2 exercises **per muscle group**
upper or lower body| 15-30 sets | 6-9 sets or 1-3 exercises **per muscle group**
chest or back | 6-20 sets | 3-6 exercises **per workout**
quads/hamstrings | 8-25 sets| 3-7 exercises **per workout**
calf workouts | 6-15 sets | 2-5 exercises **per workout**
shoulder/traps| 6-18 sets | 3-6 exercises **per workout**
biceps| 5-12 sets| 2-5 exercises **per workout**
triceps| 6-15 sets| 2-5 exercises **per workout**
forearms| 6-12 sets| 2-4 exercises **per workout**
core (abs)| 6-20 sets|3-6 exercises **per workout**

* when in doubt three to six sets per exercise
* if muscles are trained highly frequently lower the amount per workout

## frequency of workouts
#days | workout type
-------|-------------
1 | total body
2 | total body, upper/lower split
3 | total body, upper/lower, or compound split
4 | total body (with split designations), upper/lower, compound split
5 | total body (with split designations), compound/isolated split
6-7+ | compound/isolated split routine workouts- with split designations

/* split designations essentially means using olympic lifts, because olympic lifts are total body lifts the workout is considered full body workout 

**frequencies for the advanced** (p.214)
> one study showed football players training 4-5 days achieved better results than 3 or 6 days p.214
* advanced weightlifters & bodybuilders do 4-6 days a week
* double-split (two workouts sessions per day with emphasis) are common among elite weightlifters & bodybuilders
  * one study found greater strength & muscle CSA growth when training volume was split to two sessions in the day.
  * may result in 8-12 training sessions a week, maybe even 18
  * elite powerlifters
    * 4-6 days
    * not all muscle groups are trained specifically per workout using high frequency instead each muscle group will be trained 2-3 times per week.



## power technique
* ACSM recommends 1-3 sets per exercise of light to moderate loading
* 30%-60% for uppder-body exercises & 0-60% for lower body exercises
* peak power at 40-60% for bench press, 40-70% for squat, & ~70-80% for olympic lifts
  * with power speed is key, so lower intesity.
  * 30% is more effective for power than 80% in jump squat
    > "Most studies show peak power is attained in a range from 15% to 60% of 1rm for ballistic exercises suchas the jump squat and bench press throw." p. 202
* power requires a force and velocity component: 80-100% 1-6rps for force & light to moderate loading (first bullet point) for increasing fast force production
