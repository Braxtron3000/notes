# workout structure & technique

## structure
* multijoint & olympic lifts are first
* warmups are until you get loose
* **progression structure**: after performing the same lift "160 for 8 reps" for 2 weeks in a row up the ante. you won't lift for the same # of reps but  thats o.k.
* **three methods of progression** 
    * increase relative percents
    * train within RM zone
    * increase absolute amnts
* **3 types of plans** 
    1. full body
    2. split (upper & lower)
    3. specific (chest day, leg day, back day, etc.)
    



* **progression structure**: increase by 2-10% once you can do 1-2 reps over the rep zone for 2 consecutive workouts


## general technique
* do quick fast reps for strength (power)
* you need variation of intensity in your workout. So not always 80-90%.
* range builds strength
    * heavy weights 1-6rps or 80-100% 
    * stay away from near 1rm lifts as it hurts joints.

* muscle grows in all three rep ranges but the most in 6-12 range

rep range | goal
----------|-----
1-6 rps | strength
6-12 rps | hypertrophy
10-15 rps| endurance

* rest: 2-3 minutes for strength, 30-40s for low intensity

* **hypertrophy technique** - preexaustion: start with single joint before multiple joint to fatigue a certain muscle

* *volume* = # total # of sets & reps
* **volume load** = load lifted X # of sets X reps
* *Intensity* = % of 1rm being lifted

## recommended volume
workout | total volume | division | 
--------|--------|-------------
total body|3-6 sets | 3-6 sets or 1-2 exercises **per muscle group**
upper or lower body| 15-30 sets | 6-9 sets or 1-3 exercises **per muscle group**
chest or back | 6-20 sets | 3-6 exercises **per workout**
quads/hamstrings | 8-25 sets| 3-7 exercises **per workout**
calf workouts | 6-15 sets | 2-5 exercises **per workout**
shoulder/traps| 6-18 sets | 3-6 exercises **per workout**
biceps| 5-12 sets| 2-5 exercises **per workout**
triceps| 6-15 sets| 2-5 exercises **per workout**
forearms| 6-12 sets| 2-4 exercises **per workout**
core (abs)| 6-20 sets|3-6 exercises **per workout**

* when in doubt three to six sets per exercise
* if muscles are trained highly frequently lower the amount per workout

## frequency of workouts
#days | workout type
-------|-------------
1 | total body
2 | total body, upper/lower split
3 | total body, upper/lower, or compound split
4 | total body (with split designations), upper/lower, compound split
5 | total body (with split designations), compound/isolated split
6-7+ | compound/isolated split routine workouts- with split designations

/* split designations essentially means using olympic lifts, because olympic lifts are total body lifts the workout is considered full body workout 

**frequencies for the advanced** (p.214)
> one study showed football players training 4-5 days achieved better results than 3 or 6 days p.214
* advanced weightlifters & bodybuilders do 4-6 days a week
* double-split (two workouts sessions per day with emphasis) are common among elite weightlifters & bodybuilders
  * one study found greater strength & muscle CSA growth when training volume was split to two sessions in the day.
  * may result in 8-12 training sessions a week, maybe even 18
  * elite powerlifters
    * 4-6 days
    * not all muscle groups are trained specifically per workout using high frequency instead each muscle group will be trained 2-3 times per week.



## power technique
* ACSM recommends 1-3 sets per exercise of light to moderate loading
* 30%-60% for upper-body exercises & 0-60% for lower body exercises
* peak power at 40-60% for bench press, 40-70% for squat, & ~70-80% for olympic lifts
  * with power speed is key, so lower intesity.
  * 30% is more effective for power than 80% in jump squat
    > "Most studies show peak power is attained in a range from 15% to 60% of 1rm for ballistic exercises suchas the jump squat and bench press throw." p. 202
* power requires a force and velocity component: 80-100% 1-6rps for force & light to moderate loading (first bullet point) for increasing fast force production
